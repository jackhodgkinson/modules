# Modules 

This repository contains the modules that I have created for the use of statistical and machine learning techniques in Python. So far, the modules do only focus on classification tasks however in the future I am hoping to expand the range to regression and clustering tasks also. There are also some other modules related to the manipulation of image data and specifically the MedMNIST+ datasets that my undergraduate thesis is based on. Please feel free to provide any comments and improvements as I am still a novice in statistical programming and machine learning!
